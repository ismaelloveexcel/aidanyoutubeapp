Step 1: Import to Replit
Go to Replit
Click "Create Repl"
Choose "Import from GitHub"
Enter repository URL: https://github.com/ismaelloveexcel/aidanyoutubeapp
Click "Import from GitHub"
Step 2: Configure Environment Variables (Secrets)
In Replit, go to the "Secrets" tab (lock icon) and add:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
Important: Never commit these values to the repository!

Step 3: Set Up Database
Option A: Using Replit PostgreSQL (Recommended for testing)
In your Repl, click "Tools" → "Database"
Enable PostgreSQL
Copy the connection string to your Secrets as DATABASE_URL
Option B: Using External PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)
Services like Neon, Supabase, or Railway offer free PostgreSQL:

Neon - Free tier with 0.5GB storage
Supabase - Free tier with 500MB database
Railway - $5 free credit monthly
Step 4: Install Dependencies
In the Replit shell:

npm install
Step 5: Initialize Database
Run migrations to set up database tables:

npm run db:push
Step 6: Build and Run (Development)
Development Mode
npm run dev
Click the "Run" button in Replit to start the development server!

Step 7: Deploy to Production with Replit Deployments
This repository includes a pre-configured .replit file with deployment settings for Replit's autoscale deployment feature.

Using Replit Deployments (Recommended for Production)
Click the "Deploy" button in the top right corner of your Repl
Select "Autoscale" deployment type (already configured)
Review the deployment settings:
Build command: npm run build
Run command: npm install --production && npm start
Add your production environment secrets in the deployment settings
Click "Deploy" to publish your app
Deployment Configuration
The .replit file includes these deployment settings:

[deployment]
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm install --production && npm start"]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
This configuration ensures:

Your app is built before deployment
Production dependencies are installed
The app starts with npm start in production mode
Autoscaling handles traffic automatically
Step 8: Access Your App
Development: Click the "Open in new tab" button in Replit
Production: Your deployed app will have a URL like https://your-repl-name-your-username.replit.app
Replit Configuration Files
The repository includes these Replit-specific files:

.replit - Main configuration (run commands, ports)
replit.nix - Environment dependencies (Node.js, PostgreSQL)
.replitignore - Files to exclude from the Repl
